Amtrak tickets are much cheaper though, as they only cost around $15 if you book in advance (plus another $5 for the CTA ticket to the airport). You also have more limited timing options, as there are only 3 trains per day from Champaign to Chicago\n",

However, there are no such safety concerns among the most liberal arts buildings, as the rates of mental health crises are measurably lower among liberal arts students, which is reflected in the data, and thus rooftop access is not only permissible, but is often public access and often encouraged.\n",

They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful.

If you go to the actual library and find a map with all the locations of the Library of Congress numbers, you can usually find the vast array of shelves that have books you'd want to read.

Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\n",

      "Let’s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we’re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. \n",

(Not that it's easy now, but it's not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected). -> index out of range in self\n",

I bet not, so putting Ubuntu instead of Linux, paints the picture that you really aren't that familiar with Linux. Pretty much the same sentiment that you list with VS Code and Visual Studio. Most jobs really don't care what IDE or text editor you use unless they have a ton of specific scripting for those. Which I am assuming you really don't have an advance usage of those tools. Its also odd you list GCC on a different section than CMake, they should be grouped together. CMake is a build system, so I am not sure why it would not be in developer tools or why GCC.

For example, pioneered an accessible, flexible, game engine\" is a good first bullet because it's broad enough, but the rest are useless. \"Developed 2d+ shaders\", \"Implemented A\\* pathfinding\", \"Engineered a scalable, modular enemy wave system\", \"Created RPG, RTS, and Tower Defense templates\" are frankly not good bullet points if you're not game dev. If a role is hiring for Backend SWE I don't care about any of the above. You're highlighting the wrong parts of your experience. Did you work in a team? Use cloud services? Highlight other parts of what you did. Same goes with bunch of bullets under other exp.\n",
      "2. The other glaring issue is that your bullet points don't follow STAR. Firstly, I don't see a single metric/result/statistic anywhere in your resume which is definitely not helping you pass screens. Secondly, I don't see the point in some of your bullets. For example, \"Streamlined source control via Bitbucket while engaging in global communication and collaboration\" is a really weak bullet among several. Another example is, \"Created responsive particle systems for an immersive experience, consistently testing to ensure functionality\". This barely tells me anything, and \"consistently testing to ensure functionality\" is not really something to be highlighting in your resume either. I would suggest cutting this and replacing it with something else altogether, or even a stronger rephrasing might be something like \"Integrated responsive particle systems using React, Node.js, [Socket.io](http://Socket.io) to enhance user experience, resulting in 50% increase in interaction rates\" or something. You want all your bullets to follow the format of \"Developed \\[xyz\\] to accomplish \\[xyz\\] using \\[x, y, z\\], resulting in \\[xyz\\]\".\n",

The University also came under criticism and pressure from outside stakeholders.  On top of that, the Title VI investigation and settlement.  And then news nationally that activists were gearing up to do more this year.  So there are lot of reasons to explain why an institution that sometimes looked the other way last year might switch gears and go for more timely and consistent enforcement of policies this year.\n",

Polling opened for the regents at approximately 3:40pm on Saturday, and was open for around an hour. After polls closed, no update was given on the process until around 5:20, when it was announced that votes were still being counted. The next update was at around 5:50, ten minutes before the convention was scheduled to end, where an announcer said that the votes had been counted, and now the calculations had begun (votes are weighted by county in a process that was not and has not been completely disclosed to the public). Around this time, there were reports of several cop cars around the convention center, and multiple cops came inside to “make sure delegates left peacefully after the results were announced”. Finally, the announcer came back out on stage over an hour later (and an hour after the convention had ended) and announced the final tallies for each candidate, said that Illitch and Diggs won, then hurried off backstage. There were indeed boos and chants after the results, however I left soon after the announcement, so I can’t personally speak to the nature of how the group left the center.\n",

Furthermore, Hebrew is part of Jewish culture (Jews use their Hebrew names in marriage certificates/ketubahs etc.) Spiritual Zionism is very much intertwined with the Jewish ethnic identity, and to stop being spiritually Zionist is to stop being Jewish. Spiritual Zionism has nothing to do with politics.

The volume of quality applications received for any given position, especially those unrelated to a specific academic field, is so high that many good applicants don't receive much consideration. It sucks, but it is what it is. Getting a job at U-M comes to down to some combination of a) being a particularly strong and clear fit for the position, b) applying for a pretty large volume of positions, and c) luck (which may or may not include nepotism).

In your case it will be either of 250 or 280 since stats is most likely a requirement for Pysch. Some majors have their version of introduction to statistics but courses like STATS 250 satisfy the requirement for all majors whereas majors specific ones usually do so only for that major as such you cannot go wrong with it.\n",

In your case you have to find out if AP Psychology counts as Intro to psychology (as afformentioned, it doesn't do so for econ and stats) and take an intro course if it does not. \n",

      "**Positives:** MFRM is a nice major that gives you a solid background in quantitative finance, especially with regards to pricing of financial instruments. It is a niche major (you are still a math major technically it is a concentration) but has a wide range of possible career prospects, with the most lucrative being quant finance where some get 6 figure salaries right out of college. Finally, the major has a lot of overlap with statistics (entire statistics pre-requisite and 425-426 theory requirement for statistics) and somewhat with economics (you need to take econ 101-02 and can count 401-402 distributional electives for the major) so double or even triple majoring is quite easy. Finally, the major feeds nicely into the AMDP program (Quantitative Finance and Risk Management for math track and Applied Statistics if you supplement it with statistics major)  \n",
      "\n",

      "**Negatives:** That being said, when I went through the major (and I believe still currently) the major is really theoretical with a lot of fixed costs for taking any remotely applied course. Just to take MATH 423, a course primarily on pricing options, you need Math 115,116,215,217 and 425. Furthermore, most of your coursework is theoretical. This is somewhat an artefact of quantitative finance where the models are continuously refined (for example a ARMA-GARCH model with asymmetric and heavy tailed error distribution would be a considered simple even though non of the components of the model are trivial, especially estimation) and the field is very top heavy with a lot of math geniuses (ex: students taking PhD level coursework sophomores/juniors) or PhD holders dominating the field. This makes going through the AMDP track a near necessity if you want to go forward with a quant position in the industry. Finally, like all other math tracks, the coursework can get time consuming and difficult at times with a lot of variance due to most courses (in the math department, not the electives/requirements from other departments) being taught by post-docs that are here for 2-3 years (I had one or two courses during my entire major that were from full time faculty, rest were all post-docs). \n",

The major has nice exits in terms of AMDP programs or industry but the coursework is really theoretical so you need internships or other advanced courses to supplement yourself in terms of applied skills.

If you open the floodgates to less qualified students, you either have to accept that there will be a lot of failing students or that the courses will need to be made less demanding.

I’m pretty sure that regardless of if you file your taxes from your jobs as independent or dependent, financial aid will process the aid from your parents income. The only exceptions to this is if you are legally emancipated, orphan, married I think, and a few other things. Getting a job will not impact the aid you get based on your parents income lol. You need to read up on this in the student aid website and look into it for yourself. There’s a reason why so many people have issues with financial aid especially for the students that have been very independent and supporting themselves through their low incomes but aren’t able to escape their parents income which is what their aid is evaluated by. So many kids are stuck in situations where their parents income holds them back from getting grants but the parents won’t support them even though they are the single defining factor for if they can afford school or not. And if this is the case for you, which it most likely is, I would look into getting better jobs off campus because the student employment typically doesn’t pay much.\n",
